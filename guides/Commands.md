# Command registration and dispatch

## Commands

Create a module per command and define the fields with `defstruct`. A command **must contain** a field to uniquely identify the aggregate instance (e.g. `account_number`).

```elixir
defmodule OpenAccount do
  defstruct [:account_number, :initial_balance]
end
```

## Command handlers

Implement the `Commanded.Commands.Handler` behaviour consisting of a single `handle/2` function.

It receives the aggregate root state and the command to be handled. It must return the raised domain events from the aggregate root. It may return an `{:error, reason}` tuple on failure.

```elixir
defmodule OpenAccountHandler do
  @behaviour Commanded.Commands.Handler

  def handle(%BankAccount{} = aggregate, %OpenAccount{account_number: account_number, initial_balance: initial_balance}) do
    aggregate
    |> BankAccount.open_account(account_number, initial_balance)
  end
end
```

## Command dispatch and routing

You must create a router to register each command with its associated handler.

```elixir
defmodule BankRouter do
  use Commanded.Commands.Router

  dispatch OpenAccount, to: OpenAccountHandler, aggregate: BankAccount, identity: :account_number
  dispatch DepositMoney, to: DepositMoneyHandler, aggregate: BankAccount, identity: :account_number
end
```

It is also possible to route a command directly to an aggregate root, without requiring an intermediate command handler.

```elixir
defmodule BankRouter do
  use Commanded.Commands.Router

  dispatch OpenAccount, to: BankAccount, identity: :account_number
end
```

The aggregate root must implement an `execute/2` function that receives the aggregate's state and the command to execute.

You can then dispatch a command using the router.

```elixir
:ok = BankRouter.dispatch(%OpenAccount{account_number: "ACC123", initial_balance: 1_000})
```

### Timeouts

A command handler has a default timeout of 5 seconds. The same default as a `GenServer` process call. It must handle the command in this period, otherwise the call fails and the caller exits.

You can configure a different timeout value during command registration by providing a `timeout` option, defined in milliseconds:

```elixir
defmodule BankRouter do
  use Commanded.Commands.Router

  # configure a timeout of 1 second for the open account command handler
  dispatch OpenAccount, to: OpenAccountHandler, aggregate: BankAccount, identity: :account_number, timeout: 1_000
end
```

You can override the timeout value during command dispatch. This example is dispatching the open account command with a timeout of 2 seconds:

```elixir
:ok = BankRouter.dispatch(%OpenAccount{account_number: "ACC123", initial_balance: 1_000}, timeout: 2_000)
```

### Multi-command registration

Command routers support multi command registration so you can group related command handlers into the same module.

```elixir
defmodule BankRouter do
  use Commanded.Commands.Router

  dispatch [OpenAccount,CloseAccount], to: BankAccountHandler, aggregate: BankAccount, identity: :account_number
end
```

### Dispatch returning aggregate version

You can optionally choose to include the aggregate's version as part of the dispatch result by setting the  `include_aggregate_version` option to true:

```elixir
{:ok, aggregate_version} = BankRouter.dispatch(command, include_aggregate_version: true)
```

This is useful when you need to wait for an event handler, such as a read model projection, to be up-to-date before continuing execution or querying its data.

### Aggregate lifespan

By default an aggregate instance process will run indefinitely once started. You can control this by implementing the `Commanded.Aggregates.AggregateLifespan` behaviour in a module.

```elixir
defmodule BankAccountLifespan do
  @behaviour Commanded.Aggregates.AggregateLifespan

  def after_command(%OpenAccount{}), do: :infinity
  def after_command(%CloseAccount{}), do: 0
end
```

Then specify the module as the `lifespan` option when registering the command in the router.

```elixir
defmodule BankRouter do
  use Commanded.Commands.Router

  dispatch [OpenAccount,CloseAccount],
    to: BankAccountHandler, aggregate: BankAccount, lifespan: BankAccountLifespan, identity: :account_number
end
```

The timeout is specified in milliseconds, after which time the aggregate process will be stopped if no other messages are received.

You can also return `:hibernate` and the process is hibernated, it will continue its loop once a message is in its message queue. Hibernating an aggregate causes garbage collection and minimises the memory used by the process. Hibernating should not be used aggressively as too much time could be spent garbage collecting.

Return `:infinity` to keep the aggregate instance process running indefinitely.

## Middleware

Allows a command router to define middleware modules that are executed before and after success or failure of each command dispatch.

This provides an extension point to add in command validation, authorization, logging, and other behaviour that you want to be called for every command the router dispatches.

```elixir
defmodule BankingRouter do
  use Commanded.Commands.Router

  middleware CommandLogger
  middleware MyCommandValidator
  middleware AuthorizeCommand

  dispatch OpenAccount, to: OpenAccountHandler, aggregate: BankAccount, identity: :account_number
  dispatch DepositMoney, to: DepositMoneyHandler, aggregate: BankAccount, identity: :account_number
end
```

The middleware modules are executed in the order theyâ€™ve been defined. They will receive a `Commanded.Middleware.Pipeline` struct containing the command being dispatched.

### Example middleware

Implement the `Commanded.Middleware` behaviour in your module and define the `before_dispatch`, `after_dispatch`, and `after_failure` callback functions.

```elixir
defmodule NoOpMiddleware do
  @behaviour Commanded.Middleware

  alias Commanded.Middleware.Pipeline
  import Pipeline

  def before_dispatch(%Pipeline{command: command} = pipeline) do
    pipeline
  end

  def after_dispatch(%Pipeline{} = pipeline) do
    pipeline
  end

  def after_failure(%Pipeline{} = pipeline) do
    pipeline
  end
end
```

Commanded provides a `Commanded.Middleware.Logger` middleware for logging the name of each dispatched command and its execution duration.
