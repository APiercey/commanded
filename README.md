# Commanded

Use Commanded to build your own Elixir applications following the [CQRS/ES](http://cqrs.nu/Faq) pattern.

Provides support for:

- Command registration and dispatch.
- Hosting and delegation to aggregate roots.
- Event handling.
- Long running process managers.

You can use Commanded with one of the following event stores for persistence:

- [EventStore](https://github.com/slashdotdash/eventstore) Elixir library, using PostgreSQL for persistence
- Greg Young's [Event Store](https://geteventstore.com/).

Please refer to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for features, bug fixes, and any upgrade advice included for each release.

## Used in production?

Yes, Commanded is being used in production.

- Case Study: [Building a CQRS/ES web application in Elixir using Phoenix](https://10consulting.com/2017/01/04/building-a-cqrs-web-application-in-elixir-using-phoenix/)

## Example application

[Conduit](https://github.com/slashdotdash/conduit) is an open source, example Phoenix 1.3 web application implementing the CQRS/ES pattern in Elixir. It was built to demonstrate the implementation of Commanded in an Elixir application for the [Building Conduit](https://leanpub.com/buildingconduit) book.

## Limitations

Commanded is currently limited to running on a single node. Support for running on a cluster of nodes ([#39](https://github.com/slashdotdash/commanded/issues/39)) is under active development.

## Contributing

Pull requests to contribute new or improved features, and extend documentation are most welcome.

Please follow the existing coding conventions, or refer to the [Elixir style guide](https://github.com/niftyn8/elixir_style_guide).

You should include unit tests to cover any changes. Run `mix test` to execute the test suite.
